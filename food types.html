         <h2> diet,</h2>
         <p> Eat a combination of different foods,
           <br> 
          fruit, vegetables, legumes,nuts and whole grains.
          
          Adults should eat at least five portions (400g)  <br>  of fruit and vegetables per day.
           </p>

           
         <h2>  fruits and vegetables </h2>
         <p> always including veggies in your meal; eating 
           <br> 
        fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; and eating them in season. 
        <br> By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) <br>  such as diabetes,
         heart disease, stroke and cancer.
        </p>

         <h2> Multivitamin Supplements</h2>
         <p>
          To make sure you have sufficient levels of nutrients, <br>
          taking a daily multivitamin supplement is a good idea, especially  <br> when you do not have a variety of vegetables and fruits at home. Many micronutrients are vital to
          <br> your immune system, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D,  <br>
          and E, as well as zinc, iron, copper, selenium, and magnesium. However, there’s currently  <br>
           NO available evidence that adding any supplements or “miracle mineral supplements” to your diet will   <br>
           help protect you from the virus or increase recovery. In some cases,  <br>high doses of vitamins can be bad for your health.

          <br>such as mental and behavioural disorders,

          <br>  including alcohol dependence, major NCDs such as liver cirrhosis,<br> 

           some cancers and heart diseases, as well as injuries resulting from violence <br> 

           and road clashes and collisions.

          Drink 64 ounces of water every day, <br> limit caffeine and alcohol intake.
          Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate rest all contribute to good health.<br> People receive medical treatment to maintain the
          balance, when necessary. <br>Physical well-being involves pursuing a 
          <br>healthful lifestyle to decrease the risk of disease.

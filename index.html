           <h2> 1. Eat a healthy diet,</h2>
           <p> Eat a combination of different foods,
             <br> 
            fruit, vegetables, legumes,nuts and whole grains.
            
            Adults should eat at least five portions (400g)  <br>  of fruit and vegetables per day.
             </p>

             
           <h2> 2. You can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables </h2>
           <p> always including veggies in your meal; eating 
             <br> 
          fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; and eating them in season. 
          <br> By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) <br>  such as diabetes,
           heart disease, stroke and cancer.
          </p>

           <h2>3.Take Multivitamin Supplements</h2>
           <p>
            To make sure you have sufficient levels of nutrients, <br>
            taking a daily multivitamin supplement is a good idea, especially  <br> when you do not have a variety of vegetables and fruits at home. Many micronutrients are vital to
            <br> your immune system, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D,  <br>
            and E, as well as zinc, iron, copper, selenium, and magnesium. However, there’s currently  <br>
             NO available evidence that adding any supplements or “miracle mineral supplements” to your diet will   <br>
             help protect you from the virus or increase recovery. In some cases,  <br>high doses of vitamins can be bad for your health.

             some cancers and heart diseases, as well as injuries resulting from violence <br> 

             and road clashes and collisions.

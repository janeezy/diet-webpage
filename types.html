           <h2> 1.Add More Fruits & Veggies</h2>
           <p>Mix veggies into your go-to dishes. 
            Swap meat for peppers and mushrooms in your tacos or try 
            veggie pasta instead of grain pasta like one made out of black beans 
            for more plant-based protein.
             </p>

             
           <h2> 2. You can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables </h2>
           <p> Use fresh fruits and veggies whenever possible. Watch for 
            sodium in canned veggies and look 
            for canned fruit packed in water instead of syrup
             <br> 
          fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; and eating them in season. 
          <br> By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) <br>  such as diabetes,
           heart disease, stroke and cancer.
          </p>

           <h2>3.Take Multivitamin Supplements</h2>
           <p>
            To make sure you have sufficient levels of nutrients, <br>
            taking a daily multivitamin supplement is a good idea, especially  <br> when you do not have a variety of vegetables and fruits at home. Many micronutrients are vital to
            <br> your immune system, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D,  <br>
            and E, as well as zinc, iron, copper, selenium, and magnesium. However, there’s currently  <br>
             NO available evidence that adding any supplements or “miracle mineral supplements” to your diet will   <br>
             help protect you from the virus or increase recovery. In some cases,  <br>high doses of vitamins can be bad for your health.

            <h2> 4. Avoid harmful use of alcohol</h2>

            There is no safe level for drinking alcohol. <br> alcohol can lead to health problems  

            <br>such as mental and behavioural disorders,

            <br>  including alcohol dependence, major NCDs such as liver cirrhosis,<br> 

             some cancers and heart diseases, as well as injuries resulting from violence <br> 

             and road clashes and collisions.

           <h2>5. Diet. Eat plenty of fresh, non-processed foods</h2> 
            Drink 64 ounces of water every day, <br> limit caffeine and alcohol intake.
            Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate rest all contribute to good health.<br> People receive medical treatment to maintain the
            balance, when necessary. <br>Physical well-being involves pursuing a 
            <br>healthful lifestyle to decrease the risk of disease.
